# The layout for this automation framework is based on Page Object Model (POM)

# For the login and invalid login test, the following assumption were made
	# A user already registered with the site and obtained the following credentials
	# User email : test_automation_2020@test.com
	# User password : malta

# Note:
	# Test data are provided in the testdata folder directory
	
# Difficulty encountered
	# Challenges met include element not interactable which is due to the fact that
	# I did not call the keyword wait until element is visilbe.
	# This could also be due to the fact that the internet was very slow where I am holidaying
	# ... therefore, there was a time out of after 5 seconds if the element is not visible
	# I used implicit wait of 20 seconds because the internet at the area where I am holidaying is slow
